# CS61A

This repository contains my solutions to the CS61A course assignments from UC Berkeley.

The course covers the basics of programming, including data abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, control structures, data structures, and object-oriented programming. The assignments include:

-   Hog: A dice game where two players compete to be the first to reach a certain score. Implemented using control structures and higher-order functions.
-   Cats: A typing speed measurement program featured with typing autocorrect
-   Ants: A game where the player controls a colony of ants defending against invaders. Implemented using object-oriented programming.
-   Scheme: A simplified implementation of the Scheme programming language. Implemented using recursion and higher-order functions.

All code is written in Python and Scheme.

## Notes

-   These solutions were completed during the Fall 2020 semester.
-   Solutions to some of the optional questions are included.
-   Tests are not included in this repository.
-   This repository does not contain the starter code provided by the course.

## Acknowledgments

-   The course materials were provided by UC Berkeley. And was designed by all the CS61A course staff. Thank you to the staff for creating such a fun and educational program!
